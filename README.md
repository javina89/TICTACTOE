# TICTACTOE

### Here is a basic tic-tac-toe game written in Python. 

I am about two weeks into the world of Python following a Udemy course by Jose Portillo.
Tic-tac-toe was the first milestone project. After completing it, I wanted to see how
efficient I could make this game from scratch while still appearing neat and readable.

What helped in making this game more efficient was the knowledge I learned in taking
challenges from edabit and challenging real players in SoloLearn.

Update: The TicTacToeClass file is the same game written with scalability and using object 
oriented programming (Classes).
